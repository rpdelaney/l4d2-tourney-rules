######1.1.1 Conflicts of interest

Staff may participate in the tournament. Where there may be an appearance of
a conflict of interest, a tournament director will yield to a counterpart.

##Section 2: Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

#####2.1 Format
This will be a Swiss System tournament of [NUMBER] rounds. A match win
will score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores
0 points.

######2.1.1 Pairings
For the first round, matches will be paired according to the judgment
of the tournament director. For subsequent rounds, teams will be paired
at random against other teams with the same score of Won : Lost games.
There will be no eliminations due to poor results or lost games.

######2.1.2 Double jeopardy
Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than
once.

######2.1.3 Awarding a bye
In the event that a round must be paired with an uneven number of
participants, a bye will be awarded to the lowest ranked participant in
the lowest score group.

######2.1.4 Tiebreakers
Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending (see [Neustadtl Score](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonneborn-Berger_score)):

1. The result of the head-to-head matchup of the tied participants, if
applicable.
2. The sum of conventional scores of the teams each participant has
defeated.

######2.1.6 More information
If you have any questions about the Swiss System, contact a Tournament
Director or the author.

* [Wizards of the Coast](http://http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Swiss_Pairings.pdf)

#####2.2 Deadlines

Because the pairings for each round are based on prior round scoring,
each round cannot be paired until every match from the previous round is
completed. Therefore, there will be a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for matches
that remain unplayed past the round deadline.

#####2.3 Maps

######2.3.1 [MAP POOL]

######2.3.2 Finales
All finales will be played except for The Parish finale.

Competitors may be registered for only one team in the tournament. A
competitor who drops from a roster may not re-join with another team
after the registration deadline.

##Section 4: Servers

The match servers will be approved according to the following criteria:

#####4.1
The server must be dedicated and hosted by a reputable hosting
company inside the continental United States.

#####4.2
The server will have an up to date and working installation of the
configuration. The version to be played will be posted with the pairings
each round.

#####4.3
Servers with 60 tickrate will be preferred, unless both teams agree
to another tickrate.

#####4.4
Servers with [DoS Protection](https://github.com/SirPlease/IPTables) are preferred.

use, the match will be played on the server with the most even average
ping for all the competitors.

#####4.6
If no available server can be found after this process has been
exhausted, a Tournament Director must be contacted immediately.

##Section 5: Match scheduling and match rules

#####5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

######5.1.1 Scheduling deadline
Matches must be scheduled before the following Wednesday at midnight.

Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; conflicts
must be brought to the attention of the staff before the deadline.

######5.1.2 Reporting deadline
Results must be submitted, with a screenshot, by the following Sunday at
midnight. Failure to report weekly round results before the deadline
will result in a double forfeit. Under no circumstances whatsoever will
extensions be granted.

######5.1.3 Scheduling duties

######5.1.4
Each team must agree on the server at the time the match is scheduled.
However, the server IP need not be reported publicly.

#####5.2 Tardiness

Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

Each team is permitted one (1) 10-minute break per match, and only
between rounds. Extra breaks require the consent of both the other
team, and the admins or casters.

#####5.3 Casting

The players agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process. Servers should have room for up to two casters, two cameramen,
and an admin. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

#####5.4 Spectators and admins

######5.4.1 Requests for Oversight
Any team may request that an admin be present at their match. The staff
will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the
tournament results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper
behavior that may take place.

######5.4.2 Spectators
Aside from authorized casters and admins, no spectators whatsoever will
be allowed in the server during matches.

#####5.5 Ringers

Both teams must agree to allow ringers before the match, or ringers
will not be allowed.

######5.5.1
No registered competitor may ring for another team unless their team
has withdrawn from the tournament, regardless of consent from the other
team.

#####5.6 Pauses

######5.6.1 Excessive pausing
Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the TD.

######5.6.2 Penalty
The penalty for abuse of the pause function will typically be whichever
is greater between:

- a zero score for the round for the offending team, or
- an adjustment of the score of the offended team equivalent to full
  map distance (with health bonus at the time of the offense).

#####5.7 Screenshots and demos

######5.7.1 Demos are mandatory
Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted to a tournament director on request.

######5.7.2 How-to record demos
To record a demo, open the console and type “record <demoname>”.  It is
not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

######5.7.3 Screenshots are mandatory
Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

######5.7.4 Privacy
Competitors are never required to provide demos or screenshots to
anyone except the staff. They are confidential and will not be shared.

######5.7.5 Responsibility is with you
It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely
manner.  Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the
TD will result at minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds,
and possible suspension of the player from the tournament.

#####5.9 Illegal techniques

######5.9.1 Ladder blocking
It is illegal for an infected player to position himself around a
ladder in a way that blocks an enemy player trying to climb up or down,
intentionally or unintentionally. Penalties for infractions will be
decided on a case by case basis, but will typically consist of a
partial reduction of match score.

######5.9.2 Moustaschio
It is illegal for either side to hit the “Moustaschio” button on c2m4.
The penalty for infractions will be a zero score for the round, or a
700 point penalty to overall match score, whichever is greater.

#####5.10 Glitches

######5.10.1 Rescue vehicles
In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp
Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will
be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores
will be calculated manually.

######5.10.2 Unclearable survivors
If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player gains
control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

##Section 6: Addons and configuration

the intentions of the tournament directors. However, the tournament
directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All competitors are urged strongly to discuss any modifications with

the rules before making any changes. The best way to avoid the severe
penalties associated with bending or breaking these rules is to play
with a stock configuration.

up and including team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of
already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any

wait command is allowed.

######6.2.8 Command-line arguments
Command-line arguments that do not exploit nor allow the player to
exploit “cheat” cvars
