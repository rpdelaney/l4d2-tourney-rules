The tournament directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
team or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

#####1.4 Conflicts of interest

##Section 2: Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

#####2.1 Format
This will be a Swiss System tournament of 5 rounds. A match win will
score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores 0
points.

######2.1.1 Pairings
After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be
seeded according to the judgment of the tournament director. The first
round will then be paired by a "top half vs bottom half" method: for
example, if there are 10 participants then the #1 seed will be paired
against the #6 seed, the #2 seed against the #7 seed, and so on.

In subsequent rounds, partcipants will be paired at random against
others with the same record of Won : Lost games.

There will be no eliminations due to poor results or lost games.

######2.1.2 Double jeopardy
Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than
once during the tournament.

######2.1.3 Awarding a bye
In the event that a round must be paired with an uneven number of
participants, a bye will be awarded to the lowest ranked participant in
the lowest score group. A bye scores a full point.

######2.1.4 Tiebreakers
Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending (see [Buchholz-Median
tiebreak](http://www.swissperfect.com/tiebreak.htm#buchholz), also known as "Modified Median"):

1. The sum of conventional scores of the teams each participant has
defeated, excluding the lowest and highest (higher is better).
2. The result of the head-to-head matchup of the tied participants, if
applicable.

######2.1.5 More information
For information on the Swiss System, you can review the following
links:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)
* [World Chess Federation](http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=84&view=article)
* [Wizards of the Coast](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Swiss_Pairings.pdf)

If you have any further questions about the Swiss System, contact a
Tournament Director or the author.

#####2.2 Deadlines
Because the pairings are based on prior round scoring, the next round
cannot be paired until all the results of the previous round have been
reported.

Therefore, there will be a *ZERO TOLERANCE* policy for matches that
remain unreported past the round deadline.

#####2.3 Maps
- Round 1: Death Toll
- Round 2: Hard Rain
- Round 3: Swamp Fever
- Round 4: Dark Carnival
- Round 5: The Parish

######2.3.2 Finales
All finales will be played except for The Parish finale.

another tickrate.

#####4.5 DOS protection
Servers with [DoS Protection](https://github.com/SirPlease/IPTables) are preferred.

#####4.6 Disagreements

##Section 5: Match scheduling and match rules

#####5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

Players are strongly encouraged to use the free online scheduling tool
at [doodle.com](http://doodle.com): it is free, functional, does not
require registration, and supports time zones.

Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; delinquent
scheduling must be brought to the attention of the staff before the
deadline.

midnight. Failure to report weekly round results before the deadline
will result in a double forfeit. Under no circumstances whatsoever will
extensions be granted.

######5.1.3 Scheduling duties
Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

#####5.2 Tardiness
Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

Each team is permitted one (1) 10-minute break per match, and only
between rounds. Extra breaks require the consent of both the other
team, and the admins or casters.

#####5.3 Casting
The players agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

#####5.4 Spectators and admins

######5.4.1 Requests for Oversight
Any team may request that an admin be present at their match. The staff
will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament
results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that
may take place.

######5.4.2 Spectators
Aside from tournament staff and authorized casters, no spectators
whatsoever will be allowed in the server during matches.

#####5.5 Ringers
Both teams must agree to allow ringers before the match, or ringers will
not be allowed.

#####5.6 Pauses

######5.6.1 Excessive pausing
Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the TD.

The penalty for abuse of the pause function will typically be whichever
is greater between:

- a zero score for the round for the offending team, or
- an adjustment of the score of the offended team equivalent to full
  map distance (with health bonus at the time of the offense).

#####5.7 Screenshots and demos

######5.7.1 Demos are mandatory
Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted promptly to a tournament director on request.

######5.7.2 How-to record demos

not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

######5.7.3 Screenshots are mandatory
Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request
screenshots.

Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

######5.7.4 Privacy
Competitors are never required to provide demos or screenshots to anyone
except the staff. Although there is no basis for an expectation of
privacy, they are considered confidential and will be shared only for:

- Asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what
  they find in confidence
- To expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only if, it is discovered

######5.7.5 Responsibility is with you
It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely
manner.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will
result at minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds, and
possible suspension of the player from the tournament.

#####5.8 Exploits

######5.8.1 AI pathing exploits
It is illegal to intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area
that causes NPC infected to stop attacking. This includes re-entering the
safe-room, or standing behind a dynamic prop that the witch cannot
navigate around. However, is permitted to exploit witch pathing in a way
that causes her to climb over objects repeatedly.

The minimum penalty for intentionally exploiting AI pathing will be a
zero score for the round.

######5.8.2 Moustachio
It is illegal for either side to hit the “Moustachio” button on c2m4.

The minimum penalty for activating Moustaschio will be equivalent to the
full distance with health bonus for the survivor team at the time of the
infraction.

######5.8.3 Tank parking
If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be
notified in a reasonable time. Intentionally positioning a tank so that
it cannot advance when AI controlled is not allowed.

The minimum penalty for tank parking will be equivalent to full map
distance and health bonus at the time of the infraction.

######5.8.4 Spectating
Excepting Section 5.8.5, a player may spectate during the match if, and
only if:

* They have unintentionally become stuck in a clip brush or other map
  entity and cannot move, and
* The `!stuck` command is not working or unavailable.

The minimum penalty for abuse of the spectate command will be a zero
score for the round. The maximum penalty for repeated or severe
infractions will be a forfeit loss of the match.

######5.8.5 "Stuck spots"
It is illegal to exploit "stuck spots" by intentionally becoming stuck
in a map entity. If a player-controlled infected is teleported in this
way, it must be killed via `!spectate`.

######5.8.6 Death toll bridge
As survivor, it is illegal to cross the bridge on `c10m1_caves` without
climbing a ladder.

#####5.9 Glitches

######5.9.1 Rescue vehicles
In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp
Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will
be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores
will be calculated manually.

######5.9.2 Unclearable survivors
If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player gains
control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

##Section 6: Addons and configuration

the intentions of the tournament directors. However, the tournament
directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).
