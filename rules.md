## Section 1: Tournament administration

### 1.1 Staff

Tournament Director:

- an entire sleeve of fig newtons (languages: English)

Assistant Tournament Director:

- Stabbath (languages: Portuguese, Spanish, English)

Rails Barlow, founder of the RBT series, will assist the Tournament Directors
as an advisor.

### 1.2 Disputes

The Tournament Directors are the sole arbiter and court of last resort for all
disputes. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

### 1.3 Sanctions

The Tournament Directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
competitor or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

### 1.4 Conflicts of interest

Staff may participate in the tournament. Where there may be an appearance of a
conflict of interest, a Tournament Director will yield to a counterpart if
possible.

### 1.5 Official communication

Official communication will take place via the
[Discord server][discord-invite].

### 1.6 Language requirements

English fluency is not a requirement to participate in the event. The staff are
sympathetic to the challenges posed by language barriers, and have made efforts
to help.

However, language barriers are not an excuse for ignorance of the rules or
failure to follow the tournament process.

## Section 2: Tournament format

This is an International tournament consisting of two sections:

- a Swiss system tournament
- a knockout playoffs

Once the first section is completed, \[TBD\] teams will move on to the
playoffs. The playoffs section will be a double-elimination knockout
tournament.

### 2.1 International format

A match may consist of:

- Two games where each team chooses the server for one game. The winner is
  determined by the total score from both games (this is referred to as
  "Home/Away"), OR
- One game on a neutral server chosen by mutual agreement during match
  scheduling.

If the teams cannot agree on a neutral server, they will use the Home/Away
system.

See [Section 4: Servers](#section-4-servers) and
[Section 5: Match schedule](#section-5-match-schedule) for more guidance on
server selection and the scheduling process.

### 2.2 Swiss section

The first section will be a Swiss System tournament of \[TBD\] rounds. A match
win will score 1 point, a tie scores a half point, and a loss or forfeit scores
0 points.

At the beginning of a Swiss round, each team will be paired at random against
others with the same record of Won : Lost games.

There will be no eliminations from the Swiss section due to poor results or
lost games.

#### 2.2.1 Double Jeopardy

Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than once
during the Swiss section.

#### 2.2.2 Byes

If an uneven number of participants are paired in a round, a bye is awarded to
the lowest ranked participant in the lowest score group. A bye scores a full
point.

#### 2.2.3 Tiebreakers

The following criteria break ties, descending:

1. [Median Bucholz][tiebreak-mbucholz]
1. [Cumulative][tiebreak-cumulative]
1. Direct Encounter: if two teams played against each other directly then the
   winner of that encounter is given the higher placement.
1. [Sonnenborn-Berger][tiebreak-sb]

#### 2.2.4 No-shows

Forfeits distort the results by unbalancing the tiebreakers. Moreover, they
disappoint other competitors who have joined the tournament to participate in
the competition.

If you wish to withdraw from the tournament, please tell one of the Tournament
Directors by filing a ticket under `#issues`.

If your team forfeits any match, you MUST ask to be paired in the next round,
or **you will be removed from the tournament without notice.**

#### 2.2.5 References

For information on the Swiss System, you can review the following links:

- [Wikipedia][3]
- [World Chess Federation][4]
- [Wizards of the Coast][5]

#### 2.2.6 Deadlines

Because the scores from the previous round determine Swiss pairings, the next
round cannot be paired until all the results of the previous round have been
reported. Under no circumstances whatsoever will extensions be granted.

#### 2.2.7 Mapban process

Each round will use [mapban.gg](https://mapban.gg) to select the map. The map
pool for the round will be posted at the start of the round along with the
pairings.

The higher (better) playoff seed chooses who bans first. Each team takes turns
banning maps until two maps are left. Then, mapban.gg will decide the map
randomly. (Use the option "Ban until 1 maps left"
    <!-- leave the quote in English -->).

### 2.3 Finales

On 4-chapter campaigns (such as Dead Center or Swamp Fever), Chapter 4 will
always be played.

On 5-chapter campaigns, unless there is clear, documented agreement between
both teams on whether to play Chapter 5, then:

- In a neutral server match, Chapter 5 _will_ be played.
- In a Home/Away match, Chapter 5 _will not_ be played.

## Section 3: Registration process

### 3.1 Registration

You may register to participate in the tournament by posting in
`#registration`. Follow the instructions in the pinned messages.

### 3.2 Deadline

The deadline for registrations is Friday, June 28th, 2024. After this date, new
entries and requests for additions to the roster are invalid.

### 3.3 Double registration

A player may register for only one team in the tournament.

### 3.4 Banned players

A player with a permanent ban on SirPlease, or a ban on l4d2center with
duration greater than or equal to five (5) years, is ineligible for
participation in the tournament with their banned account or any alternate
account.

If a match is played with any player who is ineligible under this rule, the
minimum penalty will be to overturn the match result to a forfeit loss.

You can review the public ban lists at these external links:

- [SirPlease][banlist-sirplease]
- [l4d2Center][banlist-l4d2center]

### 3.4.1 Registration is not an exception

It is your responsibility to verify your own eligibility and that of your team.
The presence of an ineligible player on any registration list or page does not
grant an exception to this rule.

### 3.5 Roster size

Each team must have four or more players on the roster, and no more than six.

### 3.6 Other limits

There is no requirement that any participant meet any threshold for the number
of hours they have logged in Left 4 Dead 2.

There is no limit on the number of teams that may register and play in the
first section of the tournament.

## Section 4: Servers

Game servers will be selected according to the following criteria:

- The server will be dedicated and hosted by a reputable hosting company.
- The server will have an up to date and working installation of the
  configuration and plugins.
- Servers will have enough slots for up to two casters, two camera operators,
  and an administrator.
- Servers with tickrate greater than or equal to 100 are preferred, unless both
  teams agree to another tickrate.
- Servers with [DoS Protection][iptables] are preferred.

### 4.1 Home servers

The tournament is an international format. Therefore, the following rules
apply:

#### 4.1.1 Home server selection

Each team's home server will be a server that satisfies these criteria and
provides the best average ping for the members of their team.

Due to restrictions placed on internet traffic at the internet backbone level,
home servers in international matches will not be behind
"[The Great Firewall][greatfirewall-en]".

#### 4.1.2 Gamesmanship is not tolerated

It is not acceptable to choose a home server on the basis that it would provide
poor latency for the opposing team. The staff will deal with attempts at
gamesmanship in server choice.

#### 4.1.3 fakelag

The use of server-side "fakelag" is permitted with mutual agreement of both
teams.

## Section 5: Match schedule

### 5.1 Rounds and scheduling

Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday, along
with the list of maps for the selection process (see Section 2.2.7).

For each match, a discord channel will be created for scheduling. You must use
the assigned channel to schedule the match.

### 5.2 Scheduling deadline

Schedule your matches promptly. Begin negotiating the schedule early;
delinquent scheduling will result in a forfeit.

### 5.3 Scheduling duties

Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

### 5.4 Reporting results

Submit results, with a screenshot, by the following Sunday at midnight. Failure
to report results before the deadline will result in a double forfeit. Under no
circumstances whatsoever will extensions be granted.

To report match results, post in the `#results` channel as outlined in the
pinned messages. Include a screenshot of the final scores. Results will not be
accepted via _any_ other means.

### 5.5 How to schedule a match

A match schedule consists of two elements:

- The date and time, _with the time zones_, when the match will begin.
- The number of games that will be played in the match.

Competitors are strongly urged to post their complete match schedules to avoid
any possibility of miscommunication or dispute about these details at match
time.

### 5.6 Requests for oversight

Any team may request that a staff member be present at their match. The staff
will honor reasonable requests where they can, weighing conflicting personal
obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament results, and the
seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that may take place.

## Section 6: Match play

### 6.1 Spectators

Aside from tournament staff and authorized casters, no spectators will be
allowed in the server during match play.

### 6.2 Tardiness

Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in the
server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a forfeit loss
of the match.

### 6.3 Substitute players

A substitute player (<!-- leave this out of translations --> also known as a
"ringer") is a player who participates in a match for a team they are not a
member of.

A defining characteristic of a championship team is the capacity to field a
team for a match at the agreed upon date and time. Therefore, both teams must
agree to allow substitute players, or substitutes will not be allowed.

#### 6.3.1 Double agents

No registered player may be a substitute for another team.

#### 6.3.2 Limits on substitutions

Each team must field at least three (3) rostered players in each match,
regardless of consent from the opponent.

In a Home/Away match, you must use the same four players in both games.

Substitutes are not allowed in the playoff phase of the tournament, regardless
of consent from either team.

### 6.4 Demos and screenshots

To maintain public trust in the legitimacy of the competition, it is required
that each participant record their match play.

#### 6.4.1 Demos are mandatory

Players must record and save demos of their match play. Store demos until the
end of the tournament, and submit them to a Tournament Director on request. A
live stream is not a substitute for a demo.

To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`. It is not
necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to re-record
after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

#### 6.4.2 Screenshots are mandatory

Each team may pause once per map to request screenshots. Players must take a
screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the server.

#### 6.4.3 Privacy

Players are never required to give demos to anyone except the staff. Although
there is no basis for an expectation of privacy, they will be shared only for
asking second opinions of skilled and trusted players, or to expose wrongdoing
to the community.

#### 6.4.4 Responsibility is with you

It is each player's individual responsibility to record demos and screenshots,
un-corrupted, and submitted timely.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will result,
at minimum, in a zero score for any round for which they were not submitted.

### 6.5 Casting

The participants agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process.

## Section 7: Exploits

### 7.1 AI pathing exploits

Do not intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area that causes NPC
infected (such as common infected, or the witch) to stop attacking. However, it
is permitted to exploit AI pathing in a way that causes infected to climb over
obstacles repeatedly.

### 7.2 Tank pathing

If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be notified in
a reasonable time. Do not intentionally position a tank so that it cannot
advance when under AI control.

### 7.3 Spectate command

Do not use the `!spectate` command excessively or in a way that gains an unfair
advantage.

Historically, accepted uses of the spectate command have been:

- A player is out of bounds or has become stuck in an object and cannot move or
  attack the survivors.
- A player-controlled SI is not being killed by the survivors in a reasonable
  time (for example, instead of killing a spitter, the survivors are m2ing it
  repeatedly).
- The server crashed and spectating is necessary to guarantee a proper tank
  rotation.

### 7.4 "Stuck spots"

Do not exploit "stuck spots" by intentionally becoming stuck in or between
entities.

### 7.5 Spawn glitches

As infected, do not clip through a brush or other obstruction by spawning while
passing through it in "ghost mode".

### 7.6 Attacking from out of bounds

As infected, do not attack the survivors in any way from out of the normal map
bounds.

### 7.7 Hard Rain elevator

Do not skip the elevator holdout event on `c4m2_sugarmill` by any means that
allow the player to safely enter the sugar cane field without riding the
elevator or being incapacitated or killed by fall damage.

### 7.8 Death Toll 1 ladder

You many not cross the ruined bridge on `c10_m1` without climbing a ladder. If
you find yourself on the far side of the bridge and you did not climb a ladder,
you must go back and climb a ladder before progressing.

### 7.9 Atrium gas cans

As infected, you may not move gas cans on `c1m4_atrium` by punching or
scratching them.

Intentionally positioning a boomer so that cans are moved when it is popped is
allowed.

## Section 8: Glitches

### 8.1 Rescue vehicles

In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp Fever, but
also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will be replayed
following a restart round. If necessary the final scores will be calculated
manually.

## Section 9: Competitive integrity

Participants have a duty to conform to the generally accepted standards of fair
play. Deviation from those standards is cheating, and threatens the legitimacy
of the competition as a whole. Therefore, everyone will be held to a strict
standard of competitive integrity.

### 9.1 Penalties

The minimum penalty for a breach of competitive integrity is a match loss by
forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the
tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team
eligibility for any prizes.

### 9.2 Stream sniping

After the match begins, players will not obtain information from any web casts,
streams, etc., that show match play, until the match is concluded.

### 9.3 Permitted modifications

The following modifications are PERMITTED:

- All modifications to the Left 4 Dead 2 user interface that do not alter, nor
  interact with the in-game user experience nor provide additional information
  about the game state (e.g. ZoneMenu, menu music, menu fonts, menu shortcuts,
  console fonts, etc.) are allowed.
- Modifying, removing, or adding HUDs, crosshairs (including overlay
  crosshairs), and pain pointers is allowed.
- Modifying or removing gun models and animations is allowed.
- Modifying or removing "tank music" including adjusting the volume is allowed.
- Modifying or removing music played at the end of the round after a wipe,
  saferoom door closed, or player death is allowed.
- Modifying or removing the blue tint while spawning special infected in "ghost
  mode" via `left4dead2\materials\correction\ghost(.pwl)` is allowed.
- Modifying or removing the red tint that appears while spawned as special
  infected or tank via `left4dead2\materials\correction\infected(.pwl)` is
  allowed.
- Source engine configuration files and console scripts that do not exploit
  cheat-flagged cvars and do not circumvent blocks on cvars blocked by the
  competitive configuration (e.g. `mat_hdr`) are allowed.
- All launch options that do not exploit nor allow the player to exploit
  cheat-flagged cvars are allowed.
- Any configuration setting that can be set using the standard in-game GUI menu
  options is allowed.
- Modifying materials and sounds that are related to weapons or items that are
  banned in the competitive configuration (which may include: "Tier 2" weapons,
  chainsaw, M60, throwables, etc) is allowed.

### 9.4 Forbidden modifications

Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor use of
third-party software and applications that affect gameplay will be allowed,
without the public, prior, and written authorization of the Tournament
Director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

- Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models, map
  textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for rendering
  the in-game environment are forbidden.
- Any changes whatsoever to game sounds are forbidden.
- Any third-party applications, programs, or macros that read or modify memory
  to affect gameplay, or to provide information about the game state to the
  player while the game is running, are forbidden.

#### 9.4.1 Netcode toggling

After the ready-up for the first half of each map, changing the following cvars
is forbidden until both halves of the round are complete:

- `cl_interp`
- `cl_interp_ratio`
- `cl_lagcompensation`

## Section 10: Unsportsmanlike conduct

Each participant is expected conduct themselves respectfully toward others at
all times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or otherwise unsportsmanlike
conduct will not be tolerated -- neither during a tournament match, nor in any
other context.

### 10.1 Insufficient effort to win

Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has not committed to
winning the match is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 10.2 Excessive pausing

Repeated or lengthy use of the pause function disrupts the normal flow of the
match and frustrates the expectations of the spectators and other players.
Therefore, extensive pausing is unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by
staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason.

### 10.3 Excessive alltalk

Use of all-talk (`messagemode1` in console, also known as "mm1") will be held
to the strictest standard of sportsmanlike conduct during match play.

### 10.4 Sound effects

The game engine frequently causes player entities to play vocalizations in
certain circumstances automatically and involuntarily. Voluntarily triggered
vocalizations can taunt, harass, annoy, or confuse other players. Therefore,
vocalizations that are triggered by the player in any way (radial menus,
console commands, media buttons on some keyboards, etc.) are strongly
discouraged. This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

- Survivor laughter or coughing vocalizations
- Survivor death sounds, or other vocalizations associated with player state or
  health (such as incapacitation or being “black and white”)
- Triggered vocalizations or sound effects associated with director events
  (such as the rescue vehicle’s arrival, etc.)
- Special infected vocalizations

### 10.5 Sprays and steam avatars

Do not use sprays that imitate or resemble environmental objects, such as:
weapons, NPC or player models, props, or any other recognizable in-game entity.

Do not use sprays or steam avatars that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or
depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as sexually suggestive or
explicit content, racist logos, or "shock" images.

### 10.6 Respect the server hosts

Server hosts invest time and money to provide and maintain servers at no charge
to anyone using them. This competition, and competitive play in general,
depends on their continued generosity. Therefore, do not break server rules at
any time when using someone else's server.

### 10.7 Guilt by association

An entire team may be held responsible for the unsportsmanlike conduct of any
team member. Team captains are advised to consider this fact when composing
their rosters.
